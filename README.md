- 👋 Hi, I’m @KonradKot
- 👀 I’m interested in Electronics and Telecomunications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programing language like android apps and telecommunication projects in python.

- 😄 Pronouns: reliability, persistence, sensitivity
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the name "Python" for the programming language wasn't inspired by the snake? It actually comes from the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus." The creator, Guido van Rossum, was a big fan of the show! 🐍🤣
